            <h3>Why do I want to program?</h3>
            <p>
              I took my first programming class at North Seattle College in 2014, and picked it up fairly quickly. I continued taking classes in computer science, learning elements of Python, Java, and HTML. After working in a restaurant for 5 years, I decided I no longer wished to work during the evenings, and made the decision to enroll at Epicodus with the goal of starting a career in CS.

            <h3>Toby</h3>
            <p>
              Toby is an eight-year-old golden retriever, who loves to steal Kevin's food every chance he gets. He is a very friendly and loveable dog, who will get along with everyone, and knows all the other dogs in the neighborhood. His favorite activity (other than eating) is roaming through Carkeek Park. I am very lucky to have him. <span class="note">Note: Toby is my dog, and as much as you want to take him home with you I will not allow that to happen.</span>
